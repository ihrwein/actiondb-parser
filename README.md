# actiondb-parser

A fast and easy way to parse your logs into events.

## Requirements

* a C compiler installed
* rustc and cargo installed (tested from 1.5, but it can work with older versions)
* pkg-config installed
* syslog-ng 3.8 installed and can be found by pkg-config

## Usage

You have to compile the source code and copy the resulted shared library into a location
which is looked up by syslog-ng.

1. Compilation:

 ```
git clone https://github.com/ihrwein/actiondb-parser.git
cd actiondb-parser
cargo build --release
```

2. Copy the `libactiondb_parser.so` file next to `libcsvparser.so` (that's the easiest way to find
the proper directory)

 ```
cp target/release/libactiondb_parser.so <target directory>
```

3. You can use it immediately:

 ```
    parser{
        actiondb-rs(
            # the patterns will be loaded from this file
            option("pattern_file", "/home/tibi/install/syslog-ng/etc/loggen.json")
            # all the parsed keys should be prefixed with `.adb`
            option("prefix", ".adb")
        );
    };
```

Note, that in order to use the parser, you don't need the Rust runtime, it's already compiled
into the shared library. Check the required libraries with `ldd`. I suppose still you have to install
`libgcc1`.

For the exact configuration file format, check ActionDB's readme file: https://github.com/ihrwein/actiondb/blob/master/README.md
